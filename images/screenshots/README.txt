SCREENSHOT GUIDE FOR STYLE TRACKER
====================================

Please capture the following 4 screenshots and save them as PNG files in this directory:

1. tracking-classes.png
   - Show the extension tracking a CSS class (e.g., .container, .button)
   - Display the split view with the CSS file open and highlighted
   - Cursor should be on a class attribute

2. tracking-elements.png
   - Show the extension tracking an HTML element (e.g., body, h1, div)
   - Display the split view with the CSS rule highlighted
   - Cursor should be on an HTML tag name

3. internal-css.png
   - Show the extension tracking CSS from an internal <style> tag
   - Display the same file opened in split view
   - Highlight should be on the CSS rule inside the <style> tag

4. toggle-tracking.png
   - Show the eye icon in the editor title bar
   - Demonstrate the toggle feature (both enabled and disabled states if possible)
   - Can be a composite image showing both states

TIPS:
- Use a clean, simple HTML/CSS example
- Ensure good contrast and readability
- Recommended size: 1200x800 pixels or similar
- Make sure the split view and highlighting are clearly visible
- Use a popular VS Code theme for consistency
